### Assignment 1:

Read and Understand the above articles

### Assignment 2:

Make a Metaverse presentation from the Articles you have read in Assignment 1 using Google slides. 
Please Donot share the slides with anyone except me, until I instruct you to do so.

Five reasons we are doing this:

1. When making something we remember
2. To make a summary of the material
3. To teach others from this material
4. Have reference material for ourselves
5. To see who are the leaders and best workers in this group
